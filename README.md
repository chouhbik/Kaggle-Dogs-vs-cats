In this notebook, you will know:

- How to load and prepare photos of dogs and cats for modeling.
- How to develop a convolutional neural network for photo classification from scratch and evaluate model performance.

The dogs vs cats dataset refers to a dataset used for a Kaggle machine learning competition held in 2013.

The dataset is comprised of photos of dogs and cats provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of 3 million manually annotated photos. The dataset was developed as a partnership between Petfinder.com and Microsoft.
